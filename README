The program "histogram.c" reads a set of values, in the range specified by 
user, from a file 'values.txt' and generates the frequency table and 
histogram for datapoints requested by the user.

The program also outputs all values scanned to get the requisite sample size 
to a file 'scanned_values.txt' and all matching values found to 
'valid_values.txt' to test the program's correctness.
